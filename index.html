After dropping out of college, he launched his first start-up Oravel Stays, which was a budget hotel chain that provided B&B. And that elevated to OYO rooms from when he realized no other service offered a room for a budget traveler. Begun with only 11 rooms in a Gurgaon hotel, OYO rooms is now a hub for elite hotel stays with 65000 rooms in about 5500 properties across India.
